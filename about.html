          <h3>Front-end and Android developer based in Dnipro, Ukraine</h3>
          <p class="mt-5 mb-3">
            My journey to the world of coding is as unique as my diverse
            background. In the past, I pursued a career in medicine with a
            heartfelt desire to make a difference in people's lives. Despite
            dedicating many years to my medical education and embarking on a
            promising scientific career, my parallel interest in programming led
            me to advocate for new technologies within a state university. I was
            a professor's assistent, I taught srudents and I really wanted to
            make educational process more interesting and modern.

            The onset of war in Ukraine marked a turning point in my life,
            compelling my family to leave our home and prompting a career shift
            towards a profession that could be pursued anywhere in the world.
            This led me to choose frontend and mobile app development. The years
            spent in medical school honed my skills—teaching me perseverance,
            the ability to absorb vast amounts of information, and the
            determination never to give up. These qualities, coupled with my
            lifelong passion for music and ballet, contribute to my unique
            perspective.

            I firmly believe that my qualities—determination, hard work,
            responsibility, and unwavering dedication—will propel me to achieve
            outstanding results in any endeavor and profession.
